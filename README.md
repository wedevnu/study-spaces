# study-spaces 

Vision: a Yelp-like app for study spaces 

Name of app still a work in progress.


# Structure 

Note: Feel free to change the name of your team - these are simply placeholders.

There are three programming teams and one design team. 
The three programming teams and their respective description is listed below

Map UX:
The team that develops the main page of the app. How users interact with the map. How users can view locations on the map. 

Backend:
This team deals with everything user profile related as well as content management. The scope of this team will go beyond just the swift language. We should aim to replicate this project on the web using the same data.

User Experience:
The team 







## Setup:
Recommended XCode Version 16.1

1. Clone the repistory 
2. Open XCode
3. Run the project



# CODEOWNERS:

The codeowners file exists as the source of truth for relying on who owns what. Imagine, if code inside this project breaks. With a codeowners file, we can easily track down who owns the code to help resolve an error. Additionally, if you are confused about a piece of code you didn't write, you can always refer to the codeowners file to figure out who wrote it. Lastly, the codeowners file helps define what you are working on. The codeowners file lives in the main directory and should be updated whenever someone creates a folder/file that is not already covered.

### Example 1:
Below, it is saying the user dilanrocco is the owner of the .gitignore file.

```
.gitignore @dilanroocco
```

### Example 2:
Here it is saying that the MapUX team owns the the `mapux` folder. Here the mapux would own all sub-directories in the `mapux` folder.
```
MapUX/ @wedev/mapux
```

In general, it's a good idea to include your team name for a specific file/directory. However, if you are the sole owner of one part of the code, feel free to just tag yourself.
